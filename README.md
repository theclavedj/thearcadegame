# Arcade Game

As part of the FEND scholarship by Udacity and Google, I had to recreate a similar version of the popular game Frogger, which is a simple game, in which you have to help your Player to cross from one side of the canvas to the other using your keyboard (up,down,left,right) but it isn't this simple, because there are bugs waiting to haunt you and reset your position to Start. You accomplish the game once you reach upper part of the canvas, then your Player is reset to Start point.

## Installing from Github locally

1. Clone the following using GIT
   
	-git clone https://github.com/theclavedj/thearga.git

2. Load index.html in your favorite browser.

3. Play the game


## Playing Online:

The main part of the game is to reach the water, which is above the canvas. For you to reach the water, you need to avoid all the bugs and avoid colliding them using the arrows from your keyboard (up,down,left,right). Also, the game does not end -for the moment- so you can play for hours if you want.

## FAQ:

1. You should use the arrows in your keyboard to move your Player

2. Avoid the cockroaches, try to reach top part of the canvas (the water)

3. Reaching the water and/or colliding with a bug will reset Player's position to start point.
